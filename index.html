        <p>Genetic Technologist (Band 5)</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            This role covered a spectrum of wet and dry lab responsibilites
            within the molecular genetics team.
          </li>
          <li>
            I was responsible for various molecular testing protocols including
            Sanger, pyro and Next-Generation Sequencing. I created sequencing
            workflows, executed laboratory work, analysed results and generated
            reports.
          </li>
          <li>
            I worked to strict standards in a UKAS accredited laboratory and was
            involved in quality management, particularly in the areas of
            information governance and laboratory health and safety processes.

        <p>Research Technician</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            This was a highly dynamic research role that culminated in
            co-authoring a book chapter as well as being a third author to a
            multinational research paper in the field of ancient DNA, a paper I
            made significant contributions too.
          </li>
          <li>
            Tested and implemented a DNA extraction protocol specifically to
            eliminate a bias towards larger DNA fragments in DNA Extracts. This
            bias was ameliorated and yields of shorter DNA fragments increased
            significantly which was essential to increasing successful
            amplification of endogenous ancient DNA.

            â€¢ Solely responsible for the compilation, aggregation and formatting
            into an Excel database of HVRI human mitochondrial DNA haplotype,
            haplogroup and sequence data from ancient and modern populations of
            Eurasia.
